# Product Overview

## Vision
Deliver a Translation Management System (TMS) that unifies automated content ingestion, neural machine translation (NMT), and expert human review into a single platform. The system must support both language service providers (LSPs) and enterprise localization teams that need to translate web and software properties quickly, safely, and accurately.

## Value Proposition
- **Speed with accuracy** – Automated connectors, translation memory, and machine translation accelerate delivery while human-in-the-loop review protects quality.
- **Sector-aware localization** – Preconfigured workflows, glossaries, and compliance packages tailored for Government & Legal, BFSI, and E-Commerce reduce onboarding effort.
- **Operational transparency** – Real-time analytics and dashboards show translation progress, quality, and cost metrics across translators, vendors, and locales.
- **Security first** – Compliance controls, data residency options, and fine-grained permissions make the TMS viable for regulated industries.

## Target Users
| Persona | Needs |
| --- | --- |
| Localization Program Manager | Centralized control of vendors, workflows, quality metrics, and budgets. |
| LSP Project Manager | Automated job intake, translator assignment, and productivity insights. |
| In-House Translator / Reviewer | Familiar CAT tooling, access to translation memories, streamlined feedback loop. |
| DevOps / CMS Admin | Reliable connectors to CMS/Git, zero-downtime content sync, auditing. |

## Core Capabilities
1. **Content Connectivity** – Native connectors for major CMS platforms (WordPress, Drupal, Adobe Experience Manager) and Git repositories for hard-coded sites or applications.
2. **Translation Pipeline** – NMT with MT quality estimation (MTQE), risk scoring, and targeted human post-editing.
3. **Knowledge Assets** – Translation Memory (TM), Terminology Base (TB), and domain-specific glossaries.
4. **CAT Workspace** – Browser-based CAT tools with segment editor, TM/TB lookup, QA checks, and inline commenting.
5. **Automation & Orchestration** – Workflow engine that orchestrates translation jobs, assignments, SLAs, and escalations.
6. **Quality & Analytics** – MTQE dashboards, MQM error tagging, productivity metrics, and SLA compliance reporting.
7. **Security & Compliance** – Role-based access, single sign-on (SSO), encryption, audit trails, and data residency controls.
